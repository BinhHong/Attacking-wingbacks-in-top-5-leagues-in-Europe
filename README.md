# Attacking wingbacks in top 5 leagues in Europe

## Introduction
In football, **wingbacks** are the outside defenders in a team's defense, with much more emphasis on attack. They are typically used in a formation with 3 centre-backs and are called by the names left wingbacks and right wingbacks. In a formation with 2 center-backs like 4-3-3, they play very high to add more width in attack. 

In this project I will focus on **attacking aspects** of the wingbacks of top teams in 5 European Leagues: Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and League 1. The main purpose of this project is to check if there is a trend of using wingbacks in attack and to evaluate how well wingbacks take part in bulding up their team's play.

## Methodologies
1. Scrape the data from https://understat.com/.
2. Filter wingbacks and cleanse the data.
3. Visualize the data, with a heavy focus on `xGChain90`, the `expected goal chain per 90 minutes`.
4. Rank the best wingbacks and visualize by radar charts.

## Findings
1. Actually there is a trend of using wingbacks on attack, indicated by the graph

2. The best wingback is **Alphonso Davies** from Bayern Munich with leading `xGChain90` and `xGBuildup90`.
